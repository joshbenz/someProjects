Just some projects done outside of school for fun.

### max2sat

- An NP Hard problem. A conjunction of boolean clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of two variables or negated variables. The objective is to find solutions to the variables such that the most possible clauses are satisfied. This program uses a greedy local search algorithm as well as a bruteforce approach.


### Workout Generator
- This project actually started out as a class project, but we ended up taking the project a different direction. So I kept this becuase I thought it was cool. An android application that scrapes bodybuilding.com for exercises to generate a workout from user selected muscle groups. Can also view the bodybuilding.com video of the exercise from within the app. 
- bodybuilding.com has since changed things and made their content private so this doesn't work anymore :(

### PathFinder
- This project came from a book (AI techniques for Game Programming by Matt Buckland) I was reading. It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a path around obstacles from the opening to the exit. I used Ncurses to display and animate the evolution of the path.

### Kenpo (incomplete)
- This was a LAMP stack website I was working on before ditching it to use a MEAN stack for the sake of learning the MEAN stack. 

### Rooms

  - Console memory game. Project specification came from COC even though I didn't go there. http://www.canyons.edu/Departments/CMPSCI/Documents/ferguson/cs182/cs182program4Indy.html
  - I used it as a Java exercise using linked lists, graphs, stacks, and interfaces.
 
### BTree
- Reimplemented a binary tree so I could recall and help tutor my friends. And the AVL tree from my coursework is missing.
